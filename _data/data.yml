              Final Project: Fingerprint Image Processing with Verification and Identification Design and Implementation for Automated Fingerprint Identification System

              This project acts as the bachelor thesis and was made as a prototype for the Indonesian e-KTP (electronic resident identity card). In principle, fingerprints are scanned into images and processed into data that can be compared to other fingerprints that are stored in a secure remote database. In detail, the project discusses necessary image processing for turning an RGB two-dimensional fingerprint image into minutiae binary data. This project was implemented using C# in Visual Studio.

              Skills learned:
                - C
                - C#
                - Matlab
